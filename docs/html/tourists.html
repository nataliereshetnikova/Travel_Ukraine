          "My husband and I went to Ukraine for around 10 days and visited Kyiv, Lviv, Chornobyl and
          Bukovel. We visited a lot of churches and historical sites, went on hikes with an incredible guides,
          and stayed in incredible hotels throughout the holiday. Everything from transport to the itinerary was
          scheduled and planned very well by Mila. Communication from the staff was very professional and we always
          felt taken care of."</div>

          "Travel Ukraine agent, Mila was great to work with to organize our tour. Also, our local
          specialist was very helpful.
          Because of the time difference, it usually took 1 day to respond. My planning of this trip was revised (by
          me) many times, and our agent managed all of the changes easily.
          All of our transportation, accommodations, and tours was seamless. The guides were knowledgable and
          helpful."

          "Alex was incredible to deal with. From our first contact on Travel Ukraine, he was always
          available
          and made a great effort to really understand what we wanted. The trip went exactly as planned. Absolutely no
          issues along the way. And when we did have an issue on our home bound flight which had absolutely nothing to
          do with him, he was there helping us with last minute accomodation."
